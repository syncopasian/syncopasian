  <!-- <h2>Our COVID-19 Protocols</h2>

  <p>
    Syncopasian will be implementing several special policies this audition cycle as precautions against the spread of COVID-19. 
    Members of Synco will be asked to wear masks at all times during audition process, 
    auditions will be held in a room with an air purifier, and time will be taken between 
    audition slots to air out the audition room. Auditionees are encouraged to mask, 
    though as per institute policies, we will not force anyone to mask.
  </p> -->

  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Callbacks</h2>
  Based on your first-round audition, you may be invited to a second (and final)
  round of <b>callback auditions</b>, which will take place on Monday, 9/4.
  During callbacks, you'll learn excerpts from previous Synco arrangements and
  rehearse it with members of Synco, as well as other auditionees. Feel free to
  email us at
  <a href="mailto:syncopasian@mit.edu" target="_blank">syncopasian@mit.edu</a>
  if you have any questions!

  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      "What song should I sing?" -- Pick a song that you like and suits your
      singing style. Don't feel pressured to audition with a song just because
      you think we'll like it. If you're enjoying it, we'll enjoy it too!
    </li>

    <li>
      "What if I don't speak an Asian language?" -- Identifying as
      Asian/speaking an Asian language is neither a requirement nor a
      consideration in our audition process. We welcome people of all identities
      and backgrounds!
    </li>

    <li>
      "But I've never sung before!" -- No experience is necessary to join our
      group. Many of our members have never sung in public or had vocal training
      before coming to MIT, so we hope that encourages you to try auditioning!
    </li>

    <li>
      "How many people will you be taking?" -- Though the group usually is
      around 15 people, Syncopasian doesn't have caps or quotas. Our audition
      decisions any given year are entirely a function of the auditionees and
      how they fit within the group, and not things like total size of the
      group.
    </li>

    <li>
      "I'm really nervous about my audition. *~* " -- Try to relax beforehand!
      Auditions can be scary but we're super excited to hear your voice! Feel
      free to ask us questions throughout the audition if you're confused about
      something. We don't bite :)
    </li>

    <li>
      "I can't make auditions, what should I do?" -- Contact us at
      syncopasian@mit.edu and we'll try to work something out!
    </li>
  </ul>
  We can't wait to meet all of you!!!
